# Lit Modules

Experimenting with Lit Modules using reactive controllers, typed props and template sharing for easier data binding.

There is also a VSCode snippet I created in the repo that will trigger with `lit-module` and `lit-module-example`.

Depending on how you import the module you can use it as a web component, raw html template or css result.
